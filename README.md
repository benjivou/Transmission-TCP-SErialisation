The idea between this project is just to train myself to create app differents communications with differents methods. 

So you have the main panel call 'Input panel', with it the user input data.
After the this data inputs are send with a TCP message to the Output Panel and Serialize in a file. 
The 'Output panel' Show the last message receive by the TCP server.
The 'Table panel' display the list of elements serialized by the Input panel.
To try the code you have to install Gson on your idle download the jar here :
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.6.2/gson-2.6.2.jar

After launch the ./src/test/Test_UInput.java file. 

The TCP Directory is a modification of a projet made with nekoose in class :
